# use this command to start with docker run

# check if the port is free with:
# linux: netstat -ano | grep "5050"
# windows: netstat -ano | findStr "5050"
# adapt the port in appdaemon.yaml: http.url accordingly

# the environment is defined via the config located in the
# config directory (see volume for the path)
# the local path must be provided and populated with the config upfront!
