# Breaking Changes

  * You CAN safely remove all `general_` config keys from the `.env` file.\
  They are now internally autogenerated. Keep those you have deviated from the default.\
  It is recommended to do so to keep the file slim.
  * You CAN add `default_` keys to your .env file, see the .env-sample for details.
  IMPORTANT: compared to the former release where things are hardcoded, defaults are now compliant
